# notify

A message sending module. The intention of developing Notify is to achieve one simple thing - Drop in a message into notify with the destination and type of service to use, and it does the rest to send it across.

Currently, it is being developed to make use of the following providers:

 - SMTP (SSL/TLS)
 - SMS Gateway (Rest API)
 - Pub-Sub System (Faye)

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/rishabh9/notify/wiki) for more details.
